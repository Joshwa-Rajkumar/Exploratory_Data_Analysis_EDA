# Exploratory_Data_Analysis_EDA

🔍 Analysis Performed
Checked for missing values and data types

Merged different tables using PassengerId

Survival rate analysis:

By Sex

By Passenger Class

By Sex + Passenger Class

Ticket Fare analysis:

Based on Pclass (Passenger Class)

Identified outliers and used Median instead of Mean

Visualizations:

Bar plots for survival rates

Bar plots for fare distributions

Heatmaps for combined survival rates

📈 Key Findings
Females had a much higher survival rate than males.

1st Class passengers had a significantly higher survival chance compared to 3rd class.

Fare prices were highly skewed; median fares represent better central tendency than mean.

Higher class passengers generally paid more and had better chances of survival.
